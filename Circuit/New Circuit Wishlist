Properly sized gate-driver caps
SPI plugs -> AS5311, AS5047 with shielding, or something!
SPI RS232 drivers & chip select solution that works ... differential signals, all of them
Port for 'hack' sol'ns i.e. PWM, analog potentiometer inputs
Offset & 'nice' resistor networks for V_Sense, A_Sense (requires much DRV8302 datasheet reading)
DRV8302

CAN Bus on Teensy is native -> probably leave these pins open, why not? Do hz research

New FDM Wishlish

-> Better Dragchain on X Gantry
-> Dragchain Option on Y Ganty
-> Knock-free Glass Plate
