Properly sized gate-driver caps
SPI plugs -> AS5311, AS5047 with shielding, or something!
SPI RS232 drivers & chip select solution that works ... differential signals, all of them
Port for 'hack' sol'ns i.e. PWM, analog potentiometer inputs
Offset & 'nice' resistor networks for V_Sense, A_Sense (requires much DRV8302 datasheet reading)
